# Dwarves-Simulation
This program implements an algorithm, using C++, to enhance efficiency of bots within a simulation. The simulation requires the bots to search, collect, and build items (these items are generated on a grid, simulated within the terminal). The more items collected and the larger the structure built, the more efficient the algorithm is.

To run you must download the dwarves folder, after you can open your terminal and type the comman make. This will compile the necessary files to run the simualation. Once that is complete you must type ./dwarves followed by either nothing, b, or c. <br />
<br />
Running without a letter after ./dwarves creates a bot that must collect items <br />

Running with a b such as ./dwarves b, creates multiple bots <br />

Finally running with ./dwarves c, create multiple bots that must survive many days <br/>

If you wish to improve the algorithm please go into bot.cpp and make changes, do not touch other files. <br />

<br />
To recompile, first type in the terminal make clean (to remove files initally compiled) and then type in make once again.
